# MyStore

My application includes 4 features:

- Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
- Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
- Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
  Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)

## Development server

- Run `npm i` to install packages.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
